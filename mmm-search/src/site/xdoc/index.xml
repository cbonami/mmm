    <section name="About MMM::Search">
      Most applications have a need for an integrated full-text search
      to increase usability. For the java world there is an excelent 
      solution called <a href="http://lucene.apache.org">lucene</a>.
      The only problem is that lucene is a little low level and leaves 
      you with some typical problems like indexing binary file-formats.<br/>
      This project is a solution for the gap:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="mmm-search-parser/index.html">mmm-search-parser</a> 
        provides a pluggable set of parsers for multiple file-formats 
        with low memory consumption. The parsers are independent from the 
        search technology and can also be used for other scenarios.</li>
        <li><a href="mmm-search-engine/index.html">mmm-search-engine</a>
        provides API and implementation for a consistent search&#38;indexing
        solution that abstracts from lucene.</li>
      </ul>
