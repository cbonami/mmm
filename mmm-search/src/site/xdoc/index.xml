    <section name="About MMM::Search">
      Most applications have the need for an integrated full-text search
      to increase usability. For the java world there is an excelent 
      solution called <a href="http://lucene.apache.org">lucene</a>.
      The only problem is that lucene is a little low level and leaves 
      you with some typical problems like indexing binary file-formats.<br/>
      This project is a solution for the gap:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="mmm-search-indexer/index.html">mmm-search-indexer</a> 
        provides an indexer that recursively indexes locations. It supports
        incremental indexing and can be configured to your needs via some XML
        configuration file.</li>
        <li><a href="mmm-search-engine/index.html">mmm-search-engine</a>
        provides API and implementation for a consistent search
        solution that abstracts from lucene.</li>
      </ul>
      This project is a little similar to <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a>.
      However this project has quite a different approach. The key benefits of this solution are:
      <ul>
        <li>incremental indexing support</li>
        <li>automatic unicode detection</li>
        <li>central definition of schema</li>
        <li>central and flexible configuration</li>
        <li>clean API</li>
        <li>excellent Javadocs</li>
      </ul>
