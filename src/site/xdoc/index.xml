    <section name="Introduction">
      Welcome to the Project Multi-Media-Manager (MMM). The project is still under development.
      Before you get lost, first some words of what you can already find here before we 
      talk about the TODOs.
      <subsection name="Ready to use">
        This project provides the following generic components that can already be used now:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="mmm-configuration/index.html">mmm-configuration</a> gives easy access to read and write configurations.</li>
          <li><a href="mmm-search/index.html">mmm-search</a> provides a full-text solution base on lucene.</li>
          <li><a href="mmm-nls/index.html">mmm-nls</a> provides techniques for native language support beyond the capatibilities build into java.</li>
          <li><a href="mmm-util/index.html">mmm-util</a> contains serveral useful utilities.</li>
        </ul>

    <section name="About MMM">
      The Multi-Media-Manager (MMM) is a generic application plattform and 
      a enterprise content management system (ECMS) with custom modules for 
      multi-media management build on top.
      <subsection name="Codex">
        MMM is entirely written in JAVA. It makes extensive use of the JAVA 5 language.
        All code is written with focus on design &amp; quality and comes with detailed API
        documentation.<br/>
        The application is heavily based on the idioms separation of concerns (SoC) and
        inversion of control (IoC) and therefore split into tiny components 
        (see <a href="overview.html">overview</a>). This open architecture allows any 
        component implementation to be reused (by other projects) or be replaced.
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Project State">
        Even though the project exists for 6 years now, there is no CMS and no multi-media
        management available. If you are looking for open, flexible and well-designed software
        components (see "Ready to use") or you want to get involved and let the vision of 
        MMM become reality then you are at the right place.
