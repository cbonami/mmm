    <section name="About MMM">
      <p>The Multi-Media-Manager (MMM) is a generic application plattform and 
      a enterprise content management system (ECMS) with custom modules for 
      multi-media management build on top.</p>
      <subsection name="Codex">
        <p>
        MMM is entirely written in JAVA. It makes extensive use of the JAVA 5 language.
        All code is written with focus on design &amp; quality and comes with detailed API
        documentation.<br/>
        The application is heavily based on the idioms separation of concerns (SoC) and
        inversion of control (IoC) and therefore split into tiny components 
        (see <a href="overview.html">overview</a>). This open architecture allows any 
        component implementation to be reused (by other projects) or be replaced.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Project State">
        <p>
        Even though the project exists for 5 years now, there is no CMS and no multi-media
        management available. If you are looking for open, flexible and well-designed software
        components (fulltext-search-solution, configuration, user-interface, 
        container-framework, etc.) or you want to get involved and let the vision of 
        MMM become reality then you are at the right place.
