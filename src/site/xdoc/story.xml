    <section name="The Train Story">
      <p>Most of the code and documentation for this project was written on
      my daily trainrides to and from work. I needed some training to be
      able to switch contexts so quickly. At the beginning I have not really
      got my thoughts into the project before I had to switch trains.
      After some time I got used to it and now I just sit down and start
      developing. But maybe if you find a bug that was because I sat beside a
      beatyful girl in the train ;)</p>
