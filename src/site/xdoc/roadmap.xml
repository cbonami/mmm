      <p>This vision of mmm is to build an ECMS on top of the 
      <a href="mmm-framework/index.html">mmm-framework</a> using the 
      <a href="mmm-uit/index.html">mmm-uit</a> and all the other useful modules.</p>
      <p>I am currently active on the mmm-configuration and mmm-framework.
      Therefore I am working on a first release of these modules.</p>
      <p>The mmm-uit needs intensive improvements and web-support, etc.</p>
      <p>The ECMS content module (OO-database layer) is NOT yet available.
      It is still unclear if JCR (JSR 170) will be used as generic API, because it sucks.
      I already designed an own API that is not yet checked into subversion.
      Besides the generic API there will be an implementation that allows to have
      JavaBeans as content objects that can be accessed directly in your custom code 
      instead of using the generic API that is only an adaptor on the beans. This is the
      oposite approach about what current (E)CMS systems offer.
