    <h2>Setup</h2>
    To setup your development environment follow these steps:
    <macro name="toc">
      <param name="fromDepth" value="0"/>
    </macro>
      
    <section name="Install JDK 6">
      Install the <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java JDK</a> version 6 (1.6). 
      Open a shell and type the following command to verify your installation:
      <source>
java -version
      </source>
    </section>
    <section name="Install Maven">
      Install <a href="http://maven.apache.org">maven</a>.
	    Open a shell and type the following command to verify your installation:
      <source>
mvn -version
      </source>
    </section>
    <section name="Install Eclipse">
      Install <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">eclipse</a> 
      (choose "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers") on your system.
	    You can use an IDE of your choice instead but eclipse is the only 
	    IDE supported in this manual. 	    
	    <!--
	    Start eclipse (it is suggested to use
	    the default for your workspace, you can start eclipse with "-data some/other/workspace" if you need another eclipse setup).
	Create a directory "eclipse-plugins" that is writeable for the account
	you are using (e.g. somewhere in your home directory). In the eclipse workbench
	select "Help > Software updates > Find and Install...". In the dialog click the button
  "New Remote Site..." and enter "Subclipse" as Name and 
  "http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.0.x" as URL. 
	Now click on "Finish", then check the subclipse plugin and proceed the installation
	BUT before pressing "Finish" in the last dialog (after license agreement) click on
  "Change Location" and select your created "eclipse-plugins" directory. 
	Then finish the installation.<br/>
  You may also install the 
  <a href="http://maven.apache.org/eclipse-plugin.html">m2eclipse plugin</a> if you 
	like (current version 0.0.9 is NOT recommended). -->
    </section>
    <section name="Install Subversion">
      Install <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">subversion</a>. 
      It is recommended to install the native commandline client tool. 
      If you are using Windows you might want to use 
      <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org">tortoiseSVN</a> instead or 
	    additionally. If you installed the commandline client, open a shell 
	    and type the following command to verify your installation:
      <source>
svn --version
      </source>
    </section>
    <section name="Checkout">
      Check out the <a href="source-repository.html">source-repository</a> 
	    with your subversion client. With tortoiseSVN go to the folder where 
	    you want to checkout in your Windows-Exporer, perform a right-click 
	    and choose "Tortoise SVN > checkout". With the commandline client 
	    go to the directory where you want to checkout and type:
      <source>
svn co http://m-m-m.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/m-m-m/trunk/ mmm
      </source>
    </section>
    <section name="Setup">
      Open a shell and go to the directory where you checked out the repository
      and call the following command:
      <source>
setup
      </source>
      Follow the instructions of the script. It will call 
      <code>mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true</code> to generate the 
      eclipse project configuration. When you import these projects into your 
      eclipse workbench via "Import... > Existing Projects into Workspace" then 
      select the toplevel directory of your checked out repository. This will 
      allow to import all sub-projects (there are many) in one step.
