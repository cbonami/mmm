      <p>
      To setup your development environment follow these steps:
      <ol>
  <li>Install a <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java JDK</a> in version 1.5 or higher.
	Open a shell and type the following command to verify your installation:
    <source>
java -version
    </source>
  </li>
  <li>Install <a href="http://maven.apache.org">maven</a>.
	Open a shell and type the following command to verify your installation:
    <source>
mvn -version
    </source>
  </li>
        <li>Install <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">subversion</a>. It is recommended
	to install the native commandline client tool. If you are using Windows you might
	want to use <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org">tortoiseSVN</a> instead or 
	additionally.
	If you installed the commandline client, open a shell and type the following command 
	to verify your installation:
    <source>
svn --version
    </source>
        </li>
  <li>Check out the <a href="source-repository.html">source-repository</a> 
	with your subversion client. With tortoiseSVN go to the folder where you want 
	to checkout in your Windows-Exporer, perform a right-click and choose 
  "Tortoise SVN > checkout". With the commandline client go to the directory 
	where you want to checkout and type:
          <source>
svn co https://m-m-m.googlecode.com/svn/trunk mmm
          </source>
  </li>
  <li>Install <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">eclipse</a> on your system.
	You can use an IDE of your choice instead but eclipse is the only IDE supported
	in this manual. Start eclipse (it is suggested to use the default for your workspace, 
	you can start eclipse with "-data some/other/workspace" if you need another eclipse setup).
	Create a directory "eclipse-plugins" that is writeable for the account
	you are using (e.g. somewhere in your home directory). In the eclipse workbench
	select "Help > Software updates > Find and Install...". In the dialog click the button
  "New Remote Site..." and enter "Subclipse" as Name and 
  "http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.0.x" as URL. 
	Now click on "Finish", then check the subclipse plugin and proceed the installation
	BUT before pressing "Finish" in the last dialog (after license agreement) click on
  "Change Location" and select your created "eclipse-plugins" directory. 
	Then finish the installation.<br/>
  You may also install the 
  <a href="http://maven.apache.org/eclipse-plugin.html">m2eclipse plugin</a> if you 
	like (current version 0.0.9 is NOT recommended).
  </li>
  <li>Open a shell and go to the directory where you checked out the repository and call
  the following command:
  <source>
    setup
  </source>
  </li>
  <li>Open a shell, go to the directory where you checked out the repository and call
	the following command:
          <source>
mvn install
          </source>
    Be aware that on the first call maven will download "half of the internet" into your
    local repository. This will take quite a while. Further calls will be reasonable fast.
  </li>
  <li>In your locally checked out repository invoke the <code>setup-all</code> script
	in the folder <code>mmm-setup/scripts/&lt;my-os&gt;</code>.
  </li>
      </ol>
