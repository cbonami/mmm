/**
 * This is the interface for a persistent entity, which is a object that is
 * stored in a persistent store (typically a database). Every non-abstract
 * implementation of this interface is simply called a (persistence)
 * <em>entity</em>. It is typically a simple Java-Bean (with some JPA
 * annotations).<br>
 * This interface makes the following assumptions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A {@link PersistenceEntity} is identified by a {@link #getId() primary
 * key}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>ATTENTION:</b><br>
 * An entity (instance of this interface) can NOT be considered as a regular
 * Java-object. It is better to think of an entity as a direct view into the
 * persistent store. Therefore you should never make modifications (e.g. invoke
 * setters or sort list properties) that are NOT intended to be persisted.<br>
 * Further the underlying persistence-code may create dynamic proxies for your
 * entity. Therefore you should NOT declare methods (getters and setters) as
 * <code>final</code> except you exactly know what you are doing. Additionally
 * {@link #getClass()} may return a subclass of your entity that you never
 * created (see {@link PersistenceManager#getEntityClass(PersistenceEntity)}).
 * 
 * @param <ID> is the type of the {@link #getId() primary key}.

public interface PersistenceEntity<ID> {

  /**
   * This method gets the unique identifier (primary key) of this entity.<br>
   * The unique ID should be an immutable java-object that has a equivalent
   * string-representation that is returned by its implementation of
   * {@link Object#toString()}. Typical types of IDs are:
   * <ul>
   * <li>{@link Long}</li>
   * <li>{@link String}</li>
   * <li>{@link java.math.BigInteger}</li>
   * <li>{@link Integer}</li>
   * </ul>
   * However if your object is identified by something else or your ID has a
   * specific format or assumption you should use a custom class as ID. This
   * will help you to distinguish your ID from regular {@link String}s or
   * {@link Number}s and allows you to implement business-logic (such as
   * validation) directly in your ID-class.<br>
   * Implementations of {@link PersistenceEntity} should override this method
   * and return a more specific type for the ID.
   * 
   * @return the ID of this entity. It may be <code>null</code> if the object is
   *         {@link #isPersistent() transient}.

   * This method determines if this entity is <em>persistent</em>. A

   * {@link PersistenceEntityManager#save(PersistenceEntity) saved} for the
   * first time. Whenever the entity is
   * {@link PersistenceEntityManager#load(Object) loaded} it remains persistent.<br>
   * Otherwise, from the time it is constructed (outside the persistence) until
   * it is {@link PersistenceEntityManager#save(PersistenceEntity) saved} the
   * entity is called <em>transient</em>.

   * <code>0</code>.<br>
