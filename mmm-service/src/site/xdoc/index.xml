    <section name="About mmm-service">
      This project provides simple RPC services to communicate from java code to java code over the network.
      It abstracts from the underlying technology and can be used to communicate from a web-client (build with GWT)
      as well as from a native client (e.g. using Swing) to a java server (e.g. tomcat or any other recent servlet container).
      If combined with <a href="../mmm-client/index.html">mmm-client</a> this allows you to build the same rich-client from
      a single code-base both as web-client as well as native app (e.g. provided via web-start) communicating with the same
      backend server.
      To get started have a look at our <a href="http://m-m-m.sourceforge.net/images/Architecture.svg">technical architecture</a>
      and  read the <a href="http://m-m-m.sourceforge.net/apidocs/net/sf/mmm/service/api/package-summary.html#documentation">JavaDoc</a>.
