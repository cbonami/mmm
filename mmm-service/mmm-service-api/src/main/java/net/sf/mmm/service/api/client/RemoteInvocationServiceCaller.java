/**
 * This is the interface for the key component to invoke one or multiple
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.service.api.RemoteInvocationService}s from the client-side. The most simple usage is
 * given in the following example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@link RemoteInvocationServiceCaller} caller = getServiceCaller();
 * MyService myService = caller.{@link RemoteInvocationServiceCaller#getServiceClient(Class, Class, java.util.function.Consumer, java.util.function.Consumer)
 * getServiceClient}(MyService.class, MyResult.class, this::onSuccess, failure -> failure.printStackTrace());
 * myService.myMethod(myArgument1, myArgument2);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * However, there are advanced features such as queuing service calls and send them in a single technical
 * request. Therefore you should use {@link RemoteInvocationServiceQueue} as illustrated by this example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@link RemoteInvocationServiceCaller} caller = getServiceCaller();
 * {@link RemoteInvocationServiceQueue} queue = caller.{@link #newQueue()};
 * queue.{@link RemoteInvocationServiceQueue#setDefaultFailureCallback(Consumer) setDefaultFailureCallback}(this::onFailure);
 * MyService myService = queue.{@link RemoteInvocationServiceQueue#getServiceClient(Class, Class, java.util.function.Consumer, java.util.function.Consumer)
 * getServiceClient}(MyService.class, MyResult.class, this::onSuccess, null);
 * myService.myMethod(myArgument1, myArgument2);
 * ...
 * queue.{@link RemoteInvocationServiceQueue#commit() commit()};
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This might look a little complex on the first view, but it allows very powerful but quite easy usage of
 * asynchronous service invocations. In the example above a client-stub <code>myService</code> for the
 * service-interface <code>MyService</code> is created. On this you can directly invoke the actual service
 * method, here <code>myMethod</code> with the according arguments as you would do for a synchronous
 * invocation. However, the method invocation will always return a dummy result (<code>null</code> for
 * non-primitive return types) that you should ignore. Instead the method invocation including its arguments
 * is recorded by the {@link RemoteInvocationServiceQueue}. It will be send to the server when the top-level
 * queue is {@link RemoteInvocationServiceQueue#commit() committed}. When the result is received from the
 * server, it will be {@link Consumer#accept(Object) passed to a callback function}. <br/>
 * <b>NOTE:</b><br/>
 * If you are a java version less than 1.8, you can NOT use lambdas. However, we have created a backport for
 * {@link java.util.function} in <code>mmm-util-backport-java.util.function</code> that allows you to use this
 * code by providing {@link Consumer} instances via anonymous classes.
