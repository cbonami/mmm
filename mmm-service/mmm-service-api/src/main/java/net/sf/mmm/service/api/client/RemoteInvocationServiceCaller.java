/**
 * This is the interface for the key component to invoke one or multiple
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.service.api.RemoteInvocationService}s from the client-side. It should be used as
 * illustrated in the following example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@link RemoteInvocationServiceCaller} caller = getServiceCaller();
 * {@link RemoteInvocationServiceQueue} queue = caller.{@link #newQueue()};
 * MyService myService = queue.{@link RemoteInvocationServiceQueue#getServiceClient(Class, Class, java.util.function.Consumer, java.util.function.Consumer)
 * getServiceClient}(MyService.class, MyResult.class, this::onSuccess, this::onFailure);
 * myService.myMethod(myArgument1, myArgument2);
 * queue.{@link RemoteInvocationServiceQueue#commit() commit()};
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This might look a little complex on the first view, but it allows very powerful but quite easy usage of
 * asynchronous service invocations. In the example above a client-stub <code>myService</code> for the
 * service-interface <code>MyService</code> is created. On this you can directly invoke the actual service
 * method, here <code>myMethod</code> with the according arguments as you would do for a synchronous
 * invocation. However, the method invocation will always return a dummy result (<code>null</code> for
 * non-primitive return types) that you should ignore. Instead the method invocation including its arguments
 * is recorded by the {@link RemoteInvocationServiceQueue}. It will be send to the server when the top-level
 * queue is {@link RemoteInvocationServiceQueue#commit() committed}. When the result is received from the
 * server, it will be {@link Consumer#accept(Object) passed to a callback function}.
