/**
 * Provides utilities for reflecting on POJOs.
 * <h2>POJO Utilities</h2>
 * POJO is a shortcut for Plain Old Java Object and more or less means any java 
 * object. While the java beans specification is generally a good idea to 
 * follow, it is sometimes too restrictive. E.g. you might want to name a 
 * boolean getter with the prefix "has" or want to have a primitive type as 
 * setter argument while the getter has the according object type.
 * Using this utilities you are NOT limited by such restrictions.<br>
 * <br>
 * Instead of the {@link java.beans.Introspector} for java-beans or
 * <a href="http://commons.apache.org/commons-beanutils">commons-beanutils</a>,
 * you can use the advanced introspection offered by
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.reflect.pojo.descriptor.api.PojoDescriptorBuilder}.<br>
 * Further there is support to traverse a complete object-web spanned by an 
 * initial POJO based on a POJO-path (like XPath for XML) using the
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.reflect.pojo.path.api.PojoPathNavigator}.<br>
 * A simple way to create new instances of POJOs is offered by the 
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.reflect.pojo.factory.api.PojoFactory}.
