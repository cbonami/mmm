 * <a name="documentation"/><h2>Datatype Date</h2> 
 * This package provides common datatypes related to date and time.
 * For regular representation of date the common java datatypes 
 * {@link java.util.Date} and {@link java.util.Calendar} even though they are
 * totally awkward (otherwise have a look at joda time or the like). Please also
 * note the existence of {@link javax.xml.datatype.Duration} and 
 * {@link javax.xml.datatype.DatatypeFactory} as well as 
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit}.
 * However for additional purposes this package offers further datatypes.
