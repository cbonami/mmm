    <p> Provides the API for the native language support (NLS). The most 
      important entity is the {@link net.sf.mmm.nls.api.NlsMessage} that 
      allows to store an internationalized message together with the language 
      independent arguments.</p>
    <p>The localization (translation to native language) is performed by
    the {@link net.sf.mmm.nls.api.NlsTranslator}.</p>
    <p>For exceptions there is additional support via 
      {@link net.sf.mmm.nls.api.NlsThrowable}.</p>
