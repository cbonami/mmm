 * Provides advanced native language support (NLS).
 * <h2>Native Language Support</h2>
 * Applications that should be used by people all over the world need
 * <em>native language support</em> (NLS). The developers task is the
 * <em>internationalization</em> (i18n) where the application has to be
 * written in a way that the code is (mostly) independent from locale-specific
 * informations. This at least means that all messages that may be displayed to
 * the end-user have to be accessed in a way that allows <em>localization</em>
 * (l10n) to the users locale.
 * <h3>The Problem</h3>
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/no-msg-dialog.png"/>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Java already comes with great i18n support. But IMHO there are some tiny
 * peaces missing to complete the great puzzle of NLS:<br>
 * There is almost no support if an application needs NLS support that is
 * handling multiple users with different locales concurrently (e.g. a
 * web-application).<br>
 * You will typically store your messages in a
 * {@link java.util.ResourceBundle}. Now if you store the
 * technical key of the bundle in a message or exception the receiver needs the
 * proper <code>ResourceBundle</code> to decode it or he ends up with a
 * cryptical message he can NOT understand (e.g. as illustrated by the
 * screenshot).<br>
 * On the other hand you need to know the locale of the receiver to do the l10n
 * when creating the message or exception with the proper text. This is
 * impossible to solve in may situations or leading to sick design.
 * </p>
 * <h3>The Solution</h3>
 * The solution is quite simple because again Java brings parts of the solution
 * with <code>MessageFormat</code>:<br>
 * We simply bundle the message in default language together with the separated
 * locale independent arguments in one container object that is called
 * <code>NlsMessage</code>. Here is an example to clarify the idea: The i18n
 * message is "Hi {0}! How are you?" and the language independent argument is
 * the users name e.g. "Lilli". Now if we store these informations together we
 * have all we need. To get the localized message we simply translate the i18n
 * message to the proper language and then fill in the arguments. If we can NOT
 * translate we always have the message in default language which is "Hi Lilli!
 * How are you?".<br>
 * But how do we translate the i18n message without artificial intelligence? The
 * answer is very easy: We simply use the bundle in default language and do a
 * reverse lookup to get the technical key. Then we can lookup the proper
 * message in the according bundle to translate it to the according locale.<br>
 * All you have to do is creating a subclass of
 * <code>AbstractResourceBundle</code> that declares public string contants
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class MyResourceBundle extends AbstractRespourceBundle {
 *   public static final String MSG_SAY_HI = "Hi {0}! How are you?";
 *   public static final String ERR_LOGIN_IN_USE = "Sorry. The login \"{0}\" is " +
 *     "already in use. Please choose a different login.";
 * }
 </pre>
 * 
 * From your code you need to create the
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.nls.api.NlsMessage NlsMessage}</code> using this
 * constants:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  String usersName = "Lilli";
 *  {@link net.sf.mmm.util.nls.api.NlsMessage} msg = 
 *    new {@link net.sf.mmm.util.nls.NlsMessageImpl}(MyResourceBundle.MSG_SAY_HI, usersName);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * For exceptions there is additional support via <code>{@link net.sf.mmm.util.nls.NlsException}</code>
 * and <code>{@link net.sf.mmm.util.nls.NlsRuntimeException}</code>. Simply
 * derive your declared exceptions from one of these classes:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class IllegalLoginException extends {@link net.sf.mmm.util.nls.NlsException} {
 *   public IllegalLoginException(String usedLogin) {
 *     super(MyResourceBundle.ERR_LOGIN_IN_USE, usedLogin);
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Now if you throw a <code>IllegalLoginException</code>, it will behave as a
 * "regular" exception with an English message. Additionally it has methods
 * <code>getLocalizedMessage</code> and <code>printStackTrace</code> that
 * take a <code>NlsTranslator</code> interface as argument.
