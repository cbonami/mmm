/**
 * This is the interface for a <em>datatype</em>. A datatype is an object representing a value of a specific
 * type. It is typically <em>immutable</em> so it gets its value assigned at construction time and can then
 * not be modified anymore. Further, a datatype should ensure validation so it is NOT possible to create an
 * instance with an inconsistent value. Based on the {@link Datatype} a presentation layer can decide how to
 * view and how to edit the value. Therefore a structured data model should make use of custom datatypes in
 * order to be expressive.<br/>
 * Common generic datatypes are {@link String}, {@link Boolean}, {@link Long}, {@link Integer}, {@link Double}
 * and {@link java.util.Date}. They should always be accepted and supported as datatypes (even though they do
 * NOT implement this interface).<br/>
 * Even if a datatype is technically nothing but a {@link String} or a {@link Number} but logically something
 * special it is worth to define it as a dedicated datatype class already for the purpose of having a central
 * javadoc to explain it. On the other side avoid to introduce technical datatypes like <code>String32</code>
 * for a {@link String} with a maximum length of 32 characters as this is not adding value in the sense of a
 * real {@link Datatype}.<br/>
 * A datatype needs proper implementations of {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()}. It should
 * probably also be {@link Comparable}.<br/>
 * If a datatype is <em>mutable</em> this should be documented with an according reason (e.g. a Blob may allow
 * to append data as it would be inefficient to create a copy instead). In such case it is recommended to
 * declare a view interface that only declares methods to read (getters).<br/>
 * An immutable implementation of this interface should declare all its {@link java.lang.reflect.Field}s as
 * final and bind them at {@link java.lang.reflect.Constructor construction}. When ever possible it should
 * have a {@link java.lang.reflect.Constructor} that is compatible with {@link #getValue()}. It is suitable
 * and also recommended to use the class implementing the datatype as API omitting a dedicated interface if
 * possible. An {@link Enum} implementing this interface should also offer a static method called
 * <code>fromValue(V value)</code> that returns the appropriate {@link Enum} instance or <code>null</code> if
 * no such instance exists.
 * 
 * @param <V> is the generic type of the {@link #getValue() value}.
