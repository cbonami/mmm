/**
 * This is the interface for exceptions and runtime exceptions with real <em>native language support</em>
 * (NLS).<br>
 * In extension to a regular {@link Throwable throwable} it brings enhanced native language support (NLS). In
 * a server environment there can be multiple users active at a time with different locales. <br>
 * This approach aims to simplify the NLS when creating throwables with error messages. It has the following
 * principles:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The throwable itself contains the message in English language so this is always available even if
 * nationalization fails.</li>
 * <li>The language independent parts of the message are separated in an argument list that is inserted into
 * the message after nationalization.</li>
 * <li>The throwable itself does not know the component that does the actual localization which is done by the
 * callback interface {@link net.sf.mmm.util.nls.api.NlsTemplateResolver}.</li>
 * </ul>
