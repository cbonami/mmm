 * Dealing with {@link java.io.InputStream input-} and 
 * {@link java.io.OutputStream output-streams} is NOT an easy task. This package
 * provides utilities that make it easier to deal with streams, readers and 
 * writers. If a method specifies that a stream is closed, this is guaranteed on
 * success as well as in an exceptional state so your server-application does 
 * NOT run out of file-handles.<br>
