 * Whenever the javadoc of a method specifies that an object (stream, reader or
 * writer) is closed, then this means that it will be closed on successful
 * return of the method as well as in an exceptional state. If it says that an
 * object is NOT closed then the caller is responsible to ensure that it will be
 * closed properly.
