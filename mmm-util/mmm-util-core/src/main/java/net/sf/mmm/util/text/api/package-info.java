 * Provides the API for utilities that help with textual operations.
 * <h2>Text-Util API</h2>
 * The {@link net.sf.mmm.util.text.api.Singularizer} transforms a term in plural 
 * form to its according singular form (e.g. <code>"children"</code> to 
 * <code>"child"</code>). It is mainly intended for technical reasons (e.g. to
 * determine relations between <code>getChildren()</code> and 
 * <code>addChild()</code>) and less for linguistic purposes.
