 * This is the interface for a {@link UiWidgetInputField input field widget} that represents a rich text area
 * field. Such field is like {@link UiWidgetTextArea} but allows to enter rich text with markup. It should
 * support the user with a nice toolbar that allows to apply styles to the selected text (e.g. bold, italic,
 * blockquote, etc.). It should also support unordered and ordered lists as well as headings (at least four
 * levels). Also insertion of hyperlinks and images should be possible.

   * <ul>
   * <li>The value was entered using a {@link UiWidgetRichTextArea} (and NOT any other widget) in the same
   * client instance.</li>
   * <li>The value was received from a trusted server on a reliable path (using TLS) and that server strictly
   * validates all markup.</li>
   * <li>The value itself was verified to contain safe HTML or escaped to do so in the client before calling
   * this method (safest way).</li>
   * </ul>
   * It is generally forbidden that the value contains JavasSript or CSS.<br/>
   * TODO: It would be nice to have a way that this method does the latter strategy automatically.
