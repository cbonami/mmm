/**
 * This is the interface for a document of the content-repository. A document is
 * an entity of the content-model that is neither a {@link ContentFolder folder}
 * nor a {@link ContentFile file}. Such entity contains metadata and is part of
 * the custom model.<br>
 * Therefore the user can add and remove entities below this type to customize
 * the content-model. Please note that specific plugins (e.g. the multimedia
 * stuff) require that the according default entities are present. If you remove
 * default entities (declared in <code>mmm-content-entities</code>) you can
 * still use the content-repository, GUI-editor, etc. but additional plugins
 * will NOT work. Adding custom entities has no impact on the plain
 * functionality of the system.
