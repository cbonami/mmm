  ATTENTION: Each class has to declare its fields after all subclasses have 
  been declared. This means that the XML element "Class" may NOT occur after a
  "Field" element on the same level of the XML tree. Therefore the order of the
  child elements is "Class", "xi:include" (,"Entities") and then "Field".
