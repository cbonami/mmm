/**
 * This is the call-back interface used by the content-model to resolve the
 * field-types. Using the fully qualified name (e.g. <code>java.util.Date</code>)
 * for the type causes unnecessary typing and is especially bad for maintainance
 * (e.g. if the name or package of such type will be changed on refactoring, you
 * do NOT want to change this in various configuration files). Therefore a
 * logical name (e.g. <code>Date</code>) is used that can be
 * {@link #resolve(String) resolved} uniquely by this service.
