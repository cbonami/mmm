/**
 * This enum contains all available actions of the lifecycle for a component
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.framework.api.annotation.Implementation} managed by this
 * framework. {@link java.lang.reflect.Modifier#isPublic(int) Public} non-arg
 * {@link java.lang.reflect.Method Methods methods} of the
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.framework.api.annotation.Implementation} can be associated
 * with a lifecycle action. The framework will call this method in the
 * appropriate stage of the components lifecycle following the IoC (inversion of
 * control) pattern. If a lifecycle action is not declared for a specific
 * component it will simply be omitted.<br>
 * 
 * For setting up a component
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.framework.api.annotation.Implementation} the following
 * steps will be executed in the given order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link net.sf.mmm.framework.api.annotation.InstantiationPolicy instantiation}</li>
 * <li>{@link javax.annotation.Resource injection} (can be multiple)</li>
 * <li>{@link javax.annotation.PostConstruct initialization}</li>
 * <li>{@link #START}</li>
 * <li>{@link #EXECUTE}</li>
 * </ol>
 * After setting up, the component is ready to use. As far as supported, the
 * component may be {@link #PAUSE paused}. A paused component can be
 * {@link #RECONFIGURE reconfigured} and/or {@link #RESUME resumed}. This
 * intermediate lifecycle can repeat as often as desired.<br>
 * If the component is not needed anymore it's lifecycle is completed by the
 * following actions in the given order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #STOP}</li>
 * <li>{@link javax.annotation.PreDestroy dispose}</li>
 * </ol>
