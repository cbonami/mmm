 * Provides utilities for dealing with reflection.
 * <h2>Reflection Utilities</h2>
 * Java reflection is a powerful mechanism that allows flexible and generic 
 * programming. However the reflection API is NOT always easy for instance when 
 * dealing with generics.<br>
 * This project provides utilities that make reflection a lot easier. It also
 * offers features that you may not even know they where possible such as 
 * finding all classes located in the classpath or a specific package.<br>
 * Therefore {@link net.sf.mmm.util.reflect.ReflectionUtil} will help you to 
 * deal with reflection. For advanced support when reading annotations have a 
 * look at {@link net.sf.mmm.util.reflect.AnnotationUtil}.
