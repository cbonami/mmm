 * Provides utilities for concurrent programming.
 * <h2>Concurrent Utilities</h2> 
 * Java provides great utilities for concurrent programming in the package 
 * {@link java.util.concurrent}. Therefore we do NOT reinvent the wheel here.
 * You find a dummy implementation of {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} that
 * executes all {@link Runnable}s in a new {@link Thread}. It is used by some
 * other utils as fallback but can be replaced easily with a full-fledged 
 * thread-pool as provided via {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors}.
