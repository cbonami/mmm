    <section name="Include configurations">
      The idea of this configuration library is that you can have a single configuration
      tree for complex and heterogenous configuration data. This does NOT mean that you 
      should dump everything in one big file or all of your configuration is read into memory.
      <source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<myRoot xmlns:cfg="http://m-m-m.sf.net/namespaces/configuration">
  ...
  <myChild>
    <cfg:include access="file" type="xml" href="mySubConfiguration.xml" descendants="."/>
  </myChild>
  ...
</myRoot>        
]]></source>
      The &lt;cfg:include&gt; element in the XML above will automatically be replaced
      with the configuration from the XML file <em>mySubConfiguration.xml</em>.
      <!--
      If the optional attribute <em>lazy</em> is set to <em>true</em>, the included
      configuration will be loaded when the parent configuration element 
      (&lt;myChild&gt;) is accessed (via the configuration API) for the first time.
      -->
      The optional attributes <em>access</em> and <em>type</em> indicate the 
      accessor(-factory) and the format. The required attribute <em>href</em> defines 
      the location of the configuration and is interpreted by the accessor(-factory).
      For the accessor <em>file</em> you can also use glob-patterns in the path (e.g.
      <em>plugins/*/configuration.xml</em>). In this case all matching files are 
      included at this point. Finally the optional <em>descendants</em> can be used
      if you do not want to include the complete configuration document (root-node(s)) 
      but only parts of it. Therefore this attribute can be set to the path identifying
      the nodes (configuration descendants) to include.
