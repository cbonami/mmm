    Please ensure you have read the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a> before.
    <section name="Create initial configuration">
      Now you want to know how to read and create the initial root configuration.
      This part is a little tricky but please note that you only have to do it once.
      First of all you need to get an accessor for the configuration. Here is an example
      how to get access to a simple file.
      <source>
File configFile = new File("myConfig.xml");
ConfigurationAccess accessor = new FileAccess(configFile);
      </source>
      Now you have to create a document using a factory for the proper format of the 
      configuration. As we can guess from the filename the format will be XML in our 
      example. So we use the following code:
      <source>
ConfigurationFactory factory = new XmlFactory();
ConfigurationDocument document = factory.create(accessor);
Configuration configuration = document.getConfiguration();
      </source>
      Puh! That was the heavy part. Anyways this allows you to access your configuration 
      from anywhere (file, URL, database, etc.) and in any format (XML, properties, etc.).
