      <p>Great to see you here. The project needs your help. We need people for discussion,
      bug-reports, active development, internationalization, etc.</p>
      <p>
      The first step you should do is subscribe to the
      <a href="mail-lists.html">mailing list</a>.<br/>
      If you are a potential developer, you should also read the Developer Guides.
